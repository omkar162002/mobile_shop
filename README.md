# Mobile Shop Management System

The main objective of the project is to create an Mobile Store management system that allows user to search and purchase a mobiles online based on model name, Info and price.
The selected mobiles are displayed in a tabular format and the user can order their mobiles online through cash on delivery payment. Using this website the user can purchase a mobiles online instead of going out to a mobiles store and wasting time.
There are many online mobiles stores like Reliance Digital, Amazon which were designing using Html. I want to develop a similar website using java, apache tomcat server.
